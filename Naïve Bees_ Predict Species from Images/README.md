Build a machine learning model and a deep learning one to  distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee. So we are being able to identify bee species from images, 
while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, we will build a simple deep,machinelearning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees,
then load a pre-trained model for evaluation.You will use keras, scikit-learn, scikit-image, and numpy, among other popular Python libraries.
