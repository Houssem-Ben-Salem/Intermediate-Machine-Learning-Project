By looking at the demographics of traï¬ƒc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states.
Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. 
In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles.
How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?
